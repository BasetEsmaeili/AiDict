    <string name="title_temperature">Temperature</string>
    <string name="description_temperature">The temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection. The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when topP and topK are applied. Lower temperatures are good for prompts that require a more deterministic or less open-ended response, while higher temperatures can lead to more diverse or creative results. A temperature of 0 is deterministic, meaning that the highest probability response is always selected.</string>
    <string name="title_top_p">topP</string>
    <string name="description_top_p">The topP parameter changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from the most to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the topP value. For example, if tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 and the topP value is 0.5, then the model will select either A or B as the next token by using the temperature and exclude C as a candidate. The default topP value is 0.95.</string>
